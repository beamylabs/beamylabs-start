Rust-examples of how to use BeamyBroker together with .proto-files and gRPC.

## Prerequisites

1. Download and install Rust https://www.rust-lang.org/
2. Choose an IDE that you prefer to use. (If you just want to try it out,
   you can skip this part and just use the terminal)
3. Add the latest up to date .proto files from [here](../../../proto_files) to this [folder](./helper/protos)

The helper-lib will generate code from the .proto-files.
