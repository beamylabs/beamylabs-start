# Get started with BeamyBroker

## Start

Make sure you have `docker` and `docker-compose` installed, then

simple setup
```bash
SIGNALBROKER_IP={ADD YOUR HOST IP HERE} docker-compose -f docker-compose-full-system.yml up
```
advanced setup
```bash
NODE_NAME=$(scripts/resolve-ip.sh eth0) SIGNALBROKER_IP=$(scripts/resolve-ip.sh wlan0) docker-compose -f docker-compose-full-system.yml up
```

> On a generic setup `NODE_NAME` and `SIGNALBROKER_IP` will likely be set to the same value.

> `$(scripts/resolve-ip.sh eth0)` assumes that the interface for your main
> ethernet connection is called `eth0`. If that's not the case, you need to
> change `eth0` to the correct name (hint, find out using `ifconfig` or
> `ipconfig`).

> Some dated docker compose versions might show `ERROR: Invalid interpolation format for "command" option... `. If thats the case edit the [docker-compose-full-system.yml](docker-compose-full-system.yml) and replace [${SIGNALBROKER_IP:?Add SIGNALBROKER_IP to the .env file}](https://github.com/beamylabs/beamylabs-start/blob/master/docker-compose-full-system.yml#L34) with your ip resulting in `command: ./grpcwebproxy --backend_addr=192.x.x.x:50051...` manually.

> Running the above `docker-compose` command only needs to be done once. It
> persistant over system reboot, and will restart the containers upon reboot,
> over and over again.

Point your web browser at the machine running Beamybroker, an address like
`http://192.0.2.42:8080/`. If you are connected to a hosted WLAN Access Point
like `beamy-cafe42`, the address should be `http://192.168.4.1:8080/`.

> BEWARE 1: if you change your your interface settings you must restart by do doing [STOP](#stop)/[START](#start)

> BEWARE 2: if you provided wrong ip then do [STOP](#stop) and then append `--force-recreate` when doing `up` again.
 
## Stop

simple setup
```bash
SIGNALBROKER_IP={ADD YOUR HOST IP HERE} docker-compose -f docker-compose-full-system.yml down
```
advanced setup
```bash
NODE_NAME=$(scripts/resolve-ip.sh eth0) SIGNALBROKER_IP=$(scripts/resolve-ip.sh wlan0) docker-compose -f docker-compose-full-system.yml down
```

## Upgrade

simple setup
```bash
SIGNALBROKER_IP={ADD YOUR HOST IP HERE} docker-compose -f docker-compose-full-system.yml pull
```
advanced setup
```bash
NODE_NAME=$(scripts/resolve-ip.sh eth0) SIGNALBROKER_IP=$(scripts/resolve-ip.sh wlan0) docker-compose -f docker-compose-full-system.yml pull
```
